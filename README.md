# Project-3-Spam-Email-Classification-Using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

<h1>Spam Email Classification</h1>

<p> Spam email classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) involves the automatic identification of unsolicited and potentially harmful emails. This process leverages various NLP techniques to analyze the content of emails, extracting features such as keywords, phrases, and metadata to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages. Machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, are trained on labeled datasets to learn the patterns associated with spam. The goal is to improve email security by filtering out spam, enhancing user experience, and reducing the risk of phishing attacks and malware. By implementing this technology, organizations can streamline communication and protect users from unwanted disruptions. </p>

<h2>Software Requirements of the project</h2>

<p>1) <b>Python 3.x:</b> The programming language used for data analysis.</p>
<p>2) <b>NumPy:</b> For numerical data operations and array manipulation.</p>
<p>3) <b>Pandas:</b> For data importing and cleaning</p>
<p>4) <b>NPL:</b> For text pre-processing</p>
<p>5) <b>Scikit-learn:</b> For text encoding and model selection</p>
<p>6) <b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> Python IDE</p>

<h3>Execution Process of the project</h3>

<p>
The execution process for this project using the Naive Bayes algorithm typically involves several key steps, from data collection to model evaluation. Below is a structured outline of the process:

### 1. Problem Definition
   <p><b>Define the objective:</b> to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).
   <p>Identify the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

### 2. Data Collection
   <p><b>Dataset Acquisition:</b> Collect a dataset of emails that are labeled as spam or non-spam. Commonly used datasets include the Enron dataset or the SpamAssassin dataset.
    <p><b>Data Format:</b> Ensure the dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for processing.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
   <p><b>Text Cleaning:</b> Clean the email content by removing HTML tags, special characters, punctuation, and numbers.
   <p><b>Tokenization:</b> Split the text into individual words or tokens.
   <p><b>Lowercasing:</b> Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
   <p><b>Stop Word Removal:</b> Remove common words (e.g., "the", "is", "on") that do not contribute much meaning.
   <p><b>Stemming/Lemmatization:</b> Reduce words to their base or root form (optional).</p>

<h3>4. Feature Extraction</h3>
    <p><b>Feature Extraction:</b>Convert text data into numerical form.
       <p><b>>>Techniques:</b></p>
<p><b>(i)Bag of Words:</b> Represents text as a frequency count of words.
<p><b>(ii)TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):</b> Weighs the importance of words by considering their frequency in the document relative to their frequency across all documents
    

### 5. **Model Training**
   <p><b>Naive Bayes Classifier:</b> Choose an appropriate Naive Bayes variant (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes or Bernoulli Naive Bayes).
   <p><b>Train the Model:</b> Use the training dataset to fit the Naive Bayes model, which calculates the probabilities of the input features given each class (spam or ham).
   <p><b>Parameter Tuning:</b> Tune hyperparameters if necessary (though Naive Bayes typically requires less tuning than other algorithms).

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
   <p><b>Predict on the Test Set:</b> Use the trained model to classify the emails in the test set.
   <p><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as:
   <p><b>Accuracy:</b> The proportion of correctly classified emails.
   <p><b>Precision:</b> The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives (spam).
   <p><b>Recall (Sensitivity):</b> The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
   <p><b>F1 Score:</b> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
   <p><b>Confusion Matrix:</b> Visual representation of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### 7. **Model Deployment**
   <p>Deploy the model in an application or system that integrates with existing email platforms to classify incoming emails in real-time.
   <p>Consider creating a user interface that allows users to view results or manage spam filters.</p>
